# Web Discipline

**Web Discipline** is a simple and lightweight Chrome extension that helps you manage your time online by limiting daily usage on distracting websites like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and more. Set your daily time allowance, distracting website links, and let the extension track your usage. Once the limit is reached, access to the specified sites is automatically blocked for the rest of the day.

## Features

-  **Daily Time Limit:** Set the maximum hours you can spend on selected websites daily.
-  **Custom Website List:** Add any websites you want to discipline yourself from (e.g., facebook.com, youtube.com).
-  **Automatic Blocking:** Once your time is up, the extension will redirect those sites to a blank page.
-  **Daily Reset:** Your usage timer automatically resets every new day.
-  **Live Timer:** A real-time timer shows your current usage when opening the extension popup.
-  **Minimal UI:** Clean, user-friendly design with helpful tooltips and green-themed styling.
